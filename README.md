Paper entitled ''Learning to learn ecosystems from limited data'', submitted to PNAS, under review. You can find it from [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07368).

We develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the ''dynamical climate'' of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark ecological dynamical systems, as well as two real-world ecological data are used to test the framework.

# Simulation guidance

Download the time series data of all chaotic systems from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14261464) and move them into the 'data' folder. Alternatively, you can generate the chaotic data by running `save_chaos.py`. 

Run `reptile_main.py` to train the model and evaluate its performance on target ecological systems. Below is an example of a chaotic food chain system prediction using meta-learning:

To apply the model to empirical data, first download the data and move it to the 'data_real' folder. An example dataset, 'long_series.pkl', is provided and includes time series exceeding 100 points, sourced from [Global Population Dynamics Database](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F1BZ63Z8).

Run `compare_real.py` to simulate and compare the performance of the meta-learning model with a vanilla model on the same task. An example is shown below:

The MSE for one- to four-step predeictions are [0.00062, 0.0014, 0.0025, 0.0039] and [0.00040, 0.0009, 0.0017, 0.0027] for the FNN and Meta-learning, respectively.
